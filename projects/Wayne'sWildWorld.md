> ### The purpose of this project is to build a group of people who like to travel or just get out of their house. This site has multiple pages with several different functionalities such as:
>
> - #### Rotating pictures
> - #### Rolling word sets
> - **Video thumb nails that open up a youtube modal** ![Modal Image](/images/wayneswildworldImages/howModalWorks.png "How The Modal Works")
> - #### Expandable/ drop down cards
> - #### Multiple design icons
>
> ## One of the coolest features of this site is the photo library
>
> **This photo library is a gallery of photos from our past adventures displayed in a well layed out grid. That is not all however, if you click on any of the pictures you will see a slide show appear that you can click through and view the images one at a time.** ![Photo Library](/images/wayneswildworldImages/photoLibrary.png "The Photo Library Page")![Photo Library](/images/wayneswildworldImages/photoLibrarySlides.png "How The Slides Works")
