## What was included in this project
> - #### A main page that displays the 12 events that are closest *by date*
> - #### A default image that will be used if no image is uploaded
> - #### A full details page for every event
> - #### A view all events page that includes **dynamically** generated pagination. This means you will *never* have to touch the logic that handles pagination it will scale up to multiple pages on it's own
> - #### The ability for an admin to login and create, update, and delete events as they please
> - #### A rich text editor so you can display body text for events however you please

### *Favorite Part of Project*

# Strapi Backend
> #### My favorite part of this project was the fact that I was able to implement a fully functioning user backend interface using Strapi as a headless cms
