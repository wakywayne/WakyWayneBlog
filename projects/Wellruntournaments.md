# WellRunTournaments.com
## What was included in this project
> - A main page that displays the 12 events that are closest *by date*
> - A default image that will be used if no image is uploaded
> - A full details page for every event
> - A view all events page that includes **dynamically** generated pagination. This means you will *never* have to touch the logic that handles pagination it will scale up to multiple pages on it's own
> - The ability for an admin to login and create, update, and delete events as they please
> - A rich text editor so you can display body text for events however you please

## Favorite Part of Project
#### My favorite part of this project was the fact that I was able to implement a fully functioning user backend interface using Strapi as a headless cms
