> - #### A view all events page that includes **dynamically** generated pagination. This means you will *never* have to touch the logic that handles pagination it will scale up to multiple pages on it's own
> - #### The ability for an admin to login and create, update, and delete events as they please through the admin panel. With a rich text editor so you can display body text for events however you please
