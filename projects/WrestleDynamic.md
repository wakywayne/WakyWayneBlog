> #### Wrestle dynamic is where I have been working as a wrestling coach since _2018_. This place is like my home away from home and I love doing private lessons with my wrestlers. I built this website so the business would have a presence on the internet and our customers could stay in the loop about everything going on at the club

## This project includes:
> - #### A youtube modal in the footer explaining our software company [wellruntournaments](https://www.wellruntournaments.com/)
> - #### Text animations
> - #### 10 different pages
>   1. #####  A main home page
>   2. #####  A page for our reality tv show
>   3. ##### An upcoming event page for team activities
>   4. ##### A page to advertise for birthday parties
>   5. ##### A page for our strength training program
>   6. ##### A page for our BJJ program
>   7. ##### A page displaying what our practices look like
>   8. ##### A page linking to the [dynamic curriculum](http://www.wrestlingcurriculum.com/)
>        - ##### This is a large project I have been working on that was mostly built by my boss Jason Layton there is a separate article talking about this.

 ## One of the coolest features of this site is the custom schedule that I can easily update and is scrollable on mobile phones
